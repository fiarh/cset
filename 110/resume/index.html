		<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
	  	<p>
			Self-taught guitarist, self-published author, aspiring computer nerd. I consider myself open-minded, willing to understand many different perspectives&mdash;even the ones deemed controversial. I can respect people even if I don't agree with them.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
			Creative expression is my passion, whether it be through writing, playing guitar, or drawing funky characters. I'm an idealist at heart, and I tend to get lost in my own world, especially if it's a world I'm creating through writing or music.
