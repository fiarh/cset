**Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?**
<br/>
There are lots of different companies and browsers that use the internet, and there's no way all of those entities do things in the exact same way. We don't want one group to make a language that doesn't work in any another type of browser; that's just inconvenient, and other people will have to work around it, which will take time and quite possibly money.
<br/>
The internet belongs to the people. We should be able to see everything we can do with it, and we should be able to change it however we want.

**Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.**
<br/>
The element is the thing that actually shows up on the page, like a header, horizontal line, or paragraph. The tag is the thing that *indicates* where the element starts and ends.
<br/>
`This is a paragraph that displays on the page.`<br/>
`(p)These are tags for the paragraph. Just imagine them with angle brackets.(/p)`

**In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.**
<br/>
The first quote: *"The greatest teacher, failure is."*
<br/>
Yoda's saying "failure is the greatest teacher," and his meaning gets across even though the words are not in the correct order for the English language. The quote has good semantics but bad syntax, much like when you want to emphasize text with (em) and (strong) but end up doing (em)(strong)this.(/em)(/strong) Bad nesting is bad syntax.
<br/>
<br/>
The second quote: *"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."*
<br/>
*What?*
<br/>
I puzzled over this one for a bit. I figured it had something to do with writer's block because some ideas just don't want to sleep, but then I thought over "colorless green...." Colorless means dull, and I don't even know what green could be. Envy? But that's stupid. Ha.... Feeling dull *and* envious? Impossible. Something has to be *interesting* for you to envy it, right...?
<br/>
Turns out the sentence didn't mean anything at all. Of course it didn't.
<br/>
He wrote with perfect syntax, using the right types of words in the right places, but the semantics are basically nonexistent.
