**This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes?**<br/>
I definitely prefer these free-response questions over quizzes. Standardized schooling is overrated because it literally doesn't work. This stuff--the questions that require actual thought and interest--this stuff is actually effective.<br/>
So I'm pretty comfortable with questions like these, and I'm sure I'll be fine in interviews. I've learned that I only get nervous because I wouldn't want to say something "wrong," but the whole purpose of a job interview is to figure out what the interviewee is actually like as a human being. So I'd just be honest, even if I didn't know the answer to something.

**In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important.**<br/>
Parcel will save my life. It saves a ton of time by bundling files together, reading the code to figure out what you actually need, and installing the necessary dependencies automatically. All you need to host a local server is one little command, which is awesome. And the page is updated live with each change to your code, which saves a lot of [ctrl + r]s in the long run.<br/>
It also saves me from going back into each file--of which there may be thousands--and setting up new dependencies for them all. Parcel does all that boring stuff for me.

**Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example.**<br/>
Waterfall just goes in a straight line from start to finish; for Tic-Tac-Toe, we'd start by defining our requirements (need a board, need Xs and Os, etc.), and then we'd do the design (figure everything out before we actually code it), implementation (code it), and verification stages sequentially. Maintenance is the absolute last thing on our list.<br/>
Agile is a bit different in that we're doing every stage all the time. I think of it as doing Waterfall for every smaller thing in the project (e.g., going through the implementation of responsive board sizing while also being in the design stage of win declaration).
