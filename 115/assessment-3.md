**What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?**<br/>
In my experience, coming to agreements with visual design and even workflows have been difficult. I feel like people would either haggle over small details or just not communicate with each other at all. And what if they don't like each other in general?<br/>
...Can you tell I prefer working alone?<br/>
Seriously, though: Communication is paramount. People don't communicate effectively sometimes, and that can put a dent in things, especially with huge projects where everyone needs to be on (kind of) the same page.

**Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.**<br/>
A branch is a series of commits that you want to keep separate from other commits. A remote is a copy of the repository that isn't your copy (i.e., isn't stored on the local machine).<br/>
The default branch is called "master" or "main," and that's where your code goes automatically. If you wanted to test a certain feature before integrating it into the "official" code, you'd want to make another branch for that. You might call it "feature," "add-on," or anything else that indicates its purpose. That's where you'll put your new code, and it's also where you'll test it out before putting it in "main."<br/>
The default remote is just... the place where your repository was created or hosted. You can have a bunch of remotes (like a friend's computer or server) with a bunch of different copies of your repo.

**For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?**<br/>
