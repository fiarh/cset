**What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?**<br/>
In my experience, coming to agreements with visual design and even workflows have been difficult. I feel like people would either haggle over small details or just not communicate with each other at all. And what if they don't like each other in general?<br/>
...Can you tell I prefer working alone?<br/>
Seriously, though: Communication is paramount. People don't communicate effectively sometimes, and that can put a dent in things, especially with huge projects where everyone needs to be on (kind of) the same page. But teams can find ways to work through those issues if they're committed to each other and their work.

**Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.**<br/>
A branch is a series of commits that you want to keep separate from other commits. A remote is a copy of the repository that isn't your copy (i.e., it isn't stored on the local machine).<br/>
The default branch is called "master" or "main," and that's where your code goes automatically. If you wanted to test a certain feature before integrating it into the "official" code, you'd want to make another branch for that. You might call it "feature," "add-on," or anything else that indicates its purpose. That's where you'll put your new code, and it's also where you'll test it out before putting it in "main."<br/>
The default remote is just... the place where your repository was created or hosted. You can have a bunch of remotes (like a friend's computer or server) with a bunch of different copies of your repo.

**For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?**<br/>
I just used "feature branch" because that was pretty much the only one I could quickly figure out how to do. I added a few changes, created a new local branch for them, and then pushed that local branch to my own repository. When I opened the pull request on the other person's repo, everything was pretty much ready to go.
