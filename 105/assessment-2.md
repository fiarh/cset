**After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?** <br>
I like writing notes, but I don't like studying them, which will become a problem when I have to make much larger programs. I don't want to be flipping through a million pages just to get one program done. I need to study things more--ideally every day, even if I'm just skimming them.<br>
I should also check my assignments more often--or the course pages, at least, because I haven't really been doing that as much as I probably should be. I want to make sure I submit everything I need to.<br>
And I need to use the "extra resources" links because I have not clicked a single one of them so far. And I'm kind of bored already because I know most of this stuff so far, so maybe I should take time to, I dunno, learn new stuff on my own? Cuz it's not like I have anything better to do.

**Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.**<br>
A while loop takes just one expression; counters and stuff need to go in the loop body if you want to have them.<br>
For loops have 3 expressions: counter, start value, end value, and change.<br>
`for (counter = start; counter < end; counter += change)`<br>
Do-while loops execute `do` at least once *before* checking the `while` condition.

**We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?**<br>
Going straight to the coding stage sounds easier at first, but then you realize how cumbersome it can be once you actually run into a problem. You don't even have the ideas clear in your head before you start coding, so now you have to sit and think up a solution, translate that into code, and *then* write the actual code.<br>
If you write everything out in plain English before even attempting to program it, you at least have your general idea. That's your outline from which you can write the actual program.<br>
I've done that in high school already--but not with every program I wrote. Now, though, I'm definitely going to have outlines, and I'm certainly going to add more comments to my programs--for myself as much as for anyone else.
