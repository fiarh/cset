**How do you feel about the pace of the program so far? Is it too slow? Too fast? Or just right?**
<br>
The pace is perfect. As of right now, none of the stuff we've learned is entirely new to me because I learned it in high school classes. At the same time, though, we're going deeper into *how* the code actually works and *why* it is the way it is, which is fascinating to me. That's stuff I wish we'd learned about in high school. They didn't even teach us about hoisting or function styles in my AP class, and that's freaking college-level.
<br>
I'm slightly overwhelmed, but I imagine that has more to do with the fact that I'm actually using my brain for the first time in several *very long* months than it does with actually not understanding the stuff. I'm gonna have to dust off my brain for a bit. And get more sleep. Sleep would help.

**Why do you think functions are a useful tool to organize large programs?**
<br>
As the great YouTuber Thafnine put it: "You don't want spaghetti code." Spaghetti's all twisty and messy, and if you wanna find where a noodle ends, you're gonna have to pull it out or try to follow on its whole winding way through all the other noodles. And then the noodle probably breaks. Not fun.
<br>
Also, there's really no need to repeat a thousand lines of code if it can be condensed into ten lines and then called 100 times. Sure, there's a lot of jumping back and forth when the code is running, but that's what computers are made to do.
<br>
*Humans* are made to eat spaghetti. Computers are not.


**In class, we've been using the analogy of a zoo to explain scope. Describe the different types of scope using this analogy and provide examples using real JavaScript code.**
<br>
I liked the one-way mirror analogy; stuff in the local scopes can see outside their blocks into the outer scopes, but the outer scopes can't see in.
<br>
The local scopes are the enclosures where the animals are held. They can move around inside their enclosures and see stuff outside them, but the people outside (in the global scope) can't interact directly with them.
